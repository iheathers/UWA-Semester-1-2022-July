# You already wrote Fibonacci program which you just created in earlier question.
# Now update it such that it calculates the summation of Fibonacci number with each number too.

# Below is the sample for Fibonacci sequence and its summation

# Fibonacci                      Summation     i
# 0                                  0         
# 1                                  1         
# 1                                  2         
# 2                                  4         
# 3                                  7         
# 5                                  12        
# 8                                  20        

# The program should ask the user to provide an input n and displays the summation value up to that nth number in the series.
# For instance, if input is provided as 7 (n=7) then the displayed value is 20.

n = int(input())
# Don't change the above line. You need to write your code below this line. Remember to print the final value only.
